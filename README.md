# CatalogZero
React themable component catalog POC. Built on top of 'styled-components', developers can render components (ex: button) in their raw state/style, but also have the option to apply application theming to the imported components (a simple yet powerful means for maintaining and managing a consistant application wide look and feel).

More details to come as the POC grows.
